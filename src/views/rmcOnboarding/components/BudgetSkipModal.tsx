            Uploading your service charge budget gives Managing Agents the context they need to provide accurate,
            tailored quotes. Without it, your tender may receive fewer replies â€” and those that do come in may be vague
            or overpriced. We strongly recommend adding your budget to get the best results. Once your tender is live,
            you won't be able to upload it later.
